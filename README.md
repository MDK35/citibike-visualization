citibike visualization with tableau

Challenge was completed with the aide from TA's, Instructor, Google, & Stack Overflow.


#Analysis 

There are 2 dashboards included in the visualization. The first dashboard entails Trip duration, average age per station and average trip duration. One interesting observation I found was that older adults tend to use bikes more frequently and longer. According to the Average age per station visualization adults at least 45 or older rented a bike to ride. This could be due to the diet/exercise needs of older adults and ease of traversing through the city

The second dashboard entails male vs female statistics. In this visual female ride longer than males do. However there also shows an unknown column represents an outlier that rode for an average of almost 30 minutes. From this we infer that women are more likely to ride longer than men.  

Another interesting trend is that there are more start stations than end stations. This could be due to the geographic of the area or where people or most likely to end their trip to drop off their bike.
